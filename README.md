# UCP Project

## Introduction

Welcome to this Physiology and Bioinformatics project focusing on the study of Uncoupling Protein (UCP) proteins and their interactions with flavonoids. This project aims to explore the physiological implications of UCP proteins and investigate potential interactions with flavonoid compounds.

## Project Overview

### Background

Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) play a crucial role in cellular energy regulation by uncoupling the respiratory chain, influencing energy expenditure, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. This project delves into understanding the physiological functions of UCP proteins, with a particular emphasis on their interactions with flavonoids.

### Key Features

- **Bioinformatics Analysis:** Utilizes bioinformatics tools and techniques to analyze and interpret data related to UCP proteins and flavonoids.

- **Conda Environment:** The project employs Conda for managing the software environment, ensuring reproducibility and ease of collaboration.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) on your machine.

### Setting up the Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/physiology-bioinformatics-project.git
   cd physiology-bioinformatics-project
   ```
2. Create and activate the Conda environment using the requirements.txt file:

  ```bash
  conda create --name [environment_name] --file requirements.txt
  conda activate [envinronment_name]
  ```
### Running the Analysis

The full analysis is yet to be completed as of now.
Plase check the scripts folder to see how the analysis is being made.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`:** Contains datasets and input files.
- **`scripts/`:** Includes Python scripts for data analysis and processing.
- **`results/`:** Stores the output and results of the analysis.

** `data/` and `results/` folder are not present as of now, because of issues with their file size in GIT and GitHub.
